STATEMENT:
Given an n x n binary matrix grid, return the length of the shortest clear path in the matrix. If there is no clear path, return -1.

A clear path in a binary matrix is a path from the top-left cell (i.e., (0, 0)) to the bottom-right cell (i.e., (n - 1, n - 1)) such that:

All the visited cells of the path are 0.
All the adjacent cells of the path are 8-directionally connected (i.e., they are different and they share an edge or a corner).

Input: grid = [[0,0,0],[1,1,0],[1,1,0]]
Output: 4

Constraints:

- n == grid.length
- n == grid[i].length
- 1 <= n <= 100
